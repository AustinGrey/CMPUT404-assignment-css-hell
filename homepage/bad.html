        <p>
            My name is Austin Crapo. I've worked for the University of Alberta doing web application development.
            I like sushi, pizza, the internet, and good health. I dislike toast. I'm excited for autonomous vehicles.
            I'm not an Edmonton native but like to think of myself as one. Computer science has been an interest of
            mine ever since high school and the world of programming has helped me see new ways to solve all kinds of
            problems.

        <h1 id="what_done">What I've Done</h1>
        <p>
            I've worked on the following projects:
        <ul>
            <li>GLIM - A graphics library for the MIPS assembly language in X11 terminals.</li>
            <li>Graduate Payroll Requests - A system for validating and guiding requests to hire people for the University of Alberta Department of Engineering.</li>
            <li>Lab Inspection System - A system for coordinating, validating, and collecting inspections for labs in the Department of Mechanical Engineering</li>
            <li>Room Allocation System - A web based system for requesting and received allocations for office and laboratory space in the Department of Mechanical Engineering</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="what_will_do">What I Can Do For You</h1>
        <p>
            I can do web development, general application programming, CSS, HTML, and bring a smile to your team. I
            have trained in both Project Management and working in teams. I'm interested in web development in general
            but also creating systems that will allow users to automate processes and spend valuable time elsewhere.
